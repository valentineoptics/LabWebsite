              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Professor Valentine received a B.S. in mechanical engineering
                from Purdue University in 2004 and a Ph.D. in mechanical
                engineering from UC Berkeley in 2010. In 2010 he joined the
                faculty in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Vanderbilt
                University where hs is currently an Associate Professor.</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p> Prof. Valentine's past and current work includes the
                development of bulk plasmonic optical metamaterials,
                transformation inspired devices such as optical cloaks,
                dielectric metamaterials at optical frequencies, and hot
                electron devices. His work was selected by Time Magazine as one
                of the "Top 10 Scientific Discoveries in 2008". At Vanderbilt he
                has received an NSF CAREER Award and the Office of Naval
                Research Young Investigator Award for research on dielectric
                metamaterials. <a  href="files/Valentine_CV_September2019.pdf">Curriculum
